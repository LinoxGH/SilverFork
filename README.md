# SAMURAI



## What is SilverFork?

SilverFork is Team SAMURAI's semester project for the BBM384 class of 2025. With this project we realize a sophisticated food delivery system similar to the likes of YemekSepeti with 1 major difference. It does not shower you with ads and campaigns and food recommendations. We embraced a design approach to keep your eyes safe and unhurting.



## Features
- Fully implemented MVP architecture with a strong emphasis on database safety.
- Fully fledged Stakeholder implementation for Users, Restaurants, Couriers and Administators. Together with dashboards that encompasses all the information needed.
- Food ordering, reviewing, user accounts all functional and intuitively implemented.
- The restaurants can view their ongoing orders, update their status, assign couriers all from their dashboards.
- The couriers can view their assignments, mark them as delivered and change their availability from their dashboards.
- The reviews and orders can be reported by users and restaurants.
- Administrators can view order history of users and ongoing disputes(reports) from their dashboards and apply suitable actions for these disputes.
- Banning, restricting(take away user's review permission) and deleting accounts by admins.
- The restaurants can alter their menus by adding new items, updating existing items(price, name, picture) and deleting these items.
- All users can alter their profiles(profile photo, email, password) as well as deleting them.
- Cart system for buying items in bulk.
- Item search system where users can use a simple search bar to list all relevant items in all restaurants.
- Smart food and restaurant recommendation system that takes favorites, order history, and reviews into account.
